Supermarket Website - Frontend
This repository contains the frontend implementation of a Supermarket Website developed using React. The frontend integrates with the backend ASP.NET Web API to provide a seamless user experience for browsing products, managing orders, and utilizing features like adding to cart and favorites. Redux is utilized for state management, and user authentication is implemented using JWT tokens, with user data and session management stored in local storage.

Features
Product Catalog: Browse through a wide range of products categorized by type and brand.
Search Functionality: Easily search for products by name or category.
Product Details: View detailed information about each product, including price, description, and availability.
Shopping Cart: Add products to the shopping cart, review the cart contents, and proceed to checkout.
Favorites: Mark products as favorites for quick access later.
User Authentication: Register an account, log in with existing credentials, and maintain a secure session using JWT tokens.
User Profile: View and update user profile information, including shipping address and contact details.
Order History: Access a history of past orders and view order details.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for creating reusable UI elements.
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, enabling centralized state management and facilitating actions like adding to cart and managing favorites.
React Router: A routing library for React applications, enabling navigation between different components while maintaining UI state.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication and authorization, with user sessions managed via local storage.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API endpoints.
LocalStorage: Used to persist user session data, favorites, and cart items locally in the browser.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
